To visualize Figure 2 in our manuscript, please use the __'Figure2.ipynb'__ notebook, which is based on the R language. Ensure R is enabled in your Jupyter notebook; if not, install the IRkernel package in R with these commands:

install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)

For your reference, we provide the original R code. The 'DLPFC.ARI_boxplot.R' script was used to generate Figure 2c, while 'DLPFC_comp.R' produced Figures 2a and 2b. Additionally, 'DLPFC_BayesSpace.R' is tailored for BayesSpace analyses and comparisons with other methods, and 'DLPFC_SpaGCN' is for running SpaGCN results."
